## Setup Android Development Environment (Windows)

 If you are interested in learning how to develop Android apps, then the first thing you need to do is set up your Android development environment. In this article, we will guide you through the process of setting up your Android development environment on a Windows system.

 # Step 1: Install Java Development Kit (JDK)

 The first step in setting up your Android development environment is to install the Java Development Kit (JDK). Android apps are developed in Java, so you will need to install JDK in order to develop Android apps. You can download the latest version of JDK from the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-platform.html">Oracle website</a>.

 - Select your operating system and read the instructions.
 - Download and install the JRE and JDK for your operating system.
 - Once downloaded, run the installation file and follow the instructions to complete the installation.
 - Add Java path to environment variables in your system:
    * Go to Program Files where you have downloaded JDK (File name: Java)
    * Follow the path: <i>Java -> jdk -> bin</i>
    * Copy <i>'bin'</i> path
    * Search & Open "Environment Variables" in your local system.
    * Under "System Variables" open "Path".
    * Paste the copied path of "bin" file in "Path" as <i>New -> OK</i>

 # Step 2: Download and Install Android Studio
 
 The next step is to download and install Android Studio. Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing Android apps. You can download Android Studio from the official Android developer <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=Cj0KCQjwt_qgBhDFARIsABcDjOfKKyjGRW_tjMUipN2AI5Gy-GWWtLb6wsqe8twcYv70ckUwAgF1OF8aAkBbEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds">website</a>. 
 Once downloaded, run the installation file and follow the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/install">instructions</a> to complete the installation.

 # Step 3: Install Android SDK

 Android SDK is a collection of tools and libraries that are required to develop Android apps. Android Studio comes with its own version of the Android SDK, but you can also download the standalone version of the Android SDK from the official Android developer website. 
 Once downloaded, extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder of your choice.

 # Step 4: Configure Android SDK 
 
 Once you have installed the Android SDK, you need to configure it in Android Studio. 
 - To do this, open Android Studio and select "Configure" from the welcome screen. 
 - Then select "SDK Manager" from the dropdown menu. 
 - In the SDK Manager, select the "SDK Platforms" tab and select the Android version you want to develop for.
 - Then select the "SDK Tools" tab and select the tools you want to install. 
 - Click "Apply" to install the selected tools.

 # Step 5: Create a new Android project
 
 Once you have configured the Android SDK, you can create a new Android project. 
 - To do this, open Android Studio and select "Create New Project" from the welcome screen. 
 - Then follow the prompts to create a new project. 
 - You will need to specify the name of your project, the package name, the minimum SDK version, and the target SDK version.

 # Step 6: Run your app on an emulator
 
 Once you have created your Android project, you can run it on an emulator. 
 - To do this, select "Run" from the Android Studio toolbar and select "Run app" from the dropdown menu. 
 - Then select the emulator you want to use and click "OK" to run your app on the emulator.
