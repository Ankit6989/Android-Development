View binding is a feature introduced in Android Studio 3.6 that simplifies the process of accessing and manipulating views in your layout files. Here's how you can use it in your project:

Update Android Studio to version 3.6 or higher.

Enable view binding in your project by adding the following line to your module's build.gradle file:


android {
    ...
    viewBinding.enabled = true
}
In your layout file, add the <layout> tag as the root element. For example:

<layout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <LinearLayout
        android:id="@+id/container"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent">

        <TextView
            android:id="@+id/title"
            android:layout_width="wrap_content"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:text="Hello World!" />

    </LinearLayout>
</layout>
Build your project to generate the binding class. The class name will be based on the name of your layout file, in PascalCase format, suffixed with the word "Binding". For example, if your layout file is named activity_main.xml, the generated class will be named ActivityMainBinding.

In your activity or fragment, inflate the layout and obtain an instance of the binding class using the static inflate() method. For example:


class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    private lateinit var binding: ActivityMainBinding

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
        setContentView(binding.root)
        
        // Access views using binding
        binding.title.text = "Hello GitHub!"
    }
}
With view binding, you no longer need to write repetitive and error-prone code to find and manipulate views in your layout files. It also improves the performance of your app by reducing the number of findViewById() calls. Give it a try and see how it can simplify your Android development workflow!
